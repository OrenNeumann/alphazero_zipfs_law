# Paper code

To set up and run all experiments, go to the project folder and run:
```
poetry install
poetry shell
python -m src.generate_all_plots
```
This will save all plots in the paper saved to `plots`. The default is using saved data to generate all results.
To run all experiments from scratch, change the flag `load_data` to `False`. Doing so can take several hours to generate all plots.

Note: running all experiments can take several hours, it is recommended that you run them individually by calling their respective function from `generate_all_plots.py`.

## Hardware requirements

All experiments ran on a single node with 64 CPU cores and 125Gi RAM.

## Generating all results from scratch

Some experiments require importing or installing 3rd party data and software manually:
- Almost all experiments require agent training/inference data, and the trained agents. 
    These can be generated by OpenSpiel (Apache License 2.0) with the code available [here](https://github.com/OrenNeumann/AlphaZero-scaling-laws) (Apache License 2.0). Some model checkpoints used in this work were taken from the latter repository.
- Experiments calculating agent Elo require installing the [Bayeselo tool](https://www.remi-coulom.fr/Bayesian-Elo/) (GNU General Public License v3.0), and the Python API available [here](https://github.com/yytdfc/Bayesian-Elo) (GNU General Public License v3.0).
- Experiments using the Connect Four solver (`connect4_loss_plots` and `plot_policy_degradation`) require installing the solver available [here](https://github.com/PascalPons/connect4) (GNU Affero General Public License v3.0). The opening book, available as a release in the GitHub repo, should be saved in the running directory.
- The alpha-beta pruning experiment in `connect4_loss_plots` requires that the solver opening book is NOT present in the 
    parent dir (forcing the solver to perform a full search without prior data).
